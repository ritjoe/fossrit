I can only ever remember off the top of my head that [Travis-CI][10] 
used the meta-repo pattern, from at least early 2014 to late 2018, judging
from the dates given by git-blame on the README.md file in that repository.

So, here I'll try to remember to add other examples as I encounter them.

I think this one will be suitably prominent an example for many to find 
compelling: [Mozilla Developer Network][20]. 

I encountered another top-level meta-repository today, holding [code to support the reMarkable tablets][30].
